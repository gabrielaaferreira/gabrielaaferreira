# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a biochemical engineering student. I've worked with enzyme expression, natural products and now I'm venturing into molecular modeling and equipment optimization in the chemical industry.

In my spare time I study programming, in the areas of back-end and data science. I have two cats and a good collection of white wolf rpgs.
